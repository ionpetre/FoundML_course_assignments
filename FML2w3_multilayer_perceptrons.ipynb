The economic data was collected from United Nation website. Several data files have been merged together into a single dataset. The dataset aims to help answer the following key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Does the life expectancy reliably depend on the factors included in this dataset? \n",
    "\n",
    ">How much should a country having a lower life expectancy value (<65) increase its healthcare expenditure in order to improve its average lifespan?\n",
    "\n",
    ">Does life expectancy has positive or negative correlation with eating habits, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, drinking alcohol etc.\n",
    "\n",
    ">What is the impact of schooling on the lifespan of humans?\n",
    "\n",
    ">What is the impact of Immunization coverage on life expectancy?\n",
    "\n",

In this notebook we do an un-stratified split. \n",

In this notebook we will not do a grouped split, but this may be an option to be tested in a more extensive analysis. \n",
